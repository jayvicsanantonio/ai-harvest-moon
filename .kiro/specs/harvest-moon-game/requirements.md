# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Harvest Moon-like web game is a browser-based farming and life simulation game that captures the peaceful, addictive gameplay loop of the classic Harvest Moon series. Players will manage a farm, raise animals, interact with villagers, and progress through seasonal cycles while building relationships and expanding their agricultural empire.

The game targets modern web browsers using JavaScript with Canvas/WebGL rendering, featuring pixel art sprites and tile-based environments. The core experience emphasizes relaxing gameplay, meaningful progression, and engaging daily routines that encourage regular play sessions.

The system will support save/load functionality through browser localStorage, real-time gameplay with 60fps rendering, and a comprehensive progression system spanning farming, social interaction, and exploration activities.
